# Dataset Features:
- age
- sex
- chest pain type (4 values)
— Value 0: typical angina
— Value 1: atypical angina
— Value 2: non-anginal pain
— Value 3: asymptomatic
- trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
- chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
- fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
- restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
— Value 0: normal
— Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
— Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria
- thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
- exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
— Value 1: up-sloping
— Value 2: flat
— Value 3: down-sloping
- ca: number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscope
- thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect
- target : 0=low risk of heart attack, 1=high risk of heart attack

As you can see from the output above, This dataset contains 13 features and 1 target variable.
